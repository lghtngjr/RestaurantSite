            Bill's began in his backyard in Texas many years ago! He brought his recipes to New England over 15 years ago.     
        </p>
        <p>
            After friends and family raved about his great recipes he decided to open a restaurant where all could enjoy!</p>  
        <p>
            Every burger, shake, and fry at his Oceanside, Maine location is made fresh daily.</p>
